		<h1>What are FodMaps Exactly?</h1>
		<p1>To put it very simply, fodMaps are sugars, or carbs and starches, that can be poorly absorbed in the small intensine and fermented by bacteria to produce gas. What this means is that foods that are high in these sugars, or fodMaps, have the great capacity to cause gastric distress in many people; especially those who suffer from IBS or Chrones Disease. Although fodMap "allergies" so to speak, do not always present as gastric distress, so don't stop now just because you may not experience tummy troubles.</p1>

		<p2>FODMAP stands for (F)ermentable (O)ligo-saccharides (D)isaccharides (M)ono-saccharides (A)nd (P)olyols. </p2>

		<p3>Each of these is a type of sugar, carb, or starch that are found in a large variety of foods common in day-to-day life. Including fructose in excess of glucose (some fruits, honey, and high fructose corn syrup), lactose (Milk and milk products), sugar polyols (such as sorbitol and mannitol, in some fruits, vegetables and artificial sweeteners), and olygos (found in wheat, rye, onion, garlic, legumes and chickpeas).</p3>
